- **HAProxy:** HAProxy (High Availability Proxy) is open source proxy and load balancing server software. It provides high availability at the network (TCP) and application (HTTP/S) layers, improving speed and performance by distributing workload across multiple servers. See: [An Introduction to HAProxy and LB Concepts](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-haproxy-and-load-balancing-concepts)
- **HAProxy _in Kubernetes_:** HAProxy Ingress Controller is the most efficient way to route traffic into a Kubernetes cluster. The Kubernetes API provides a way for you to control how ingress traffic routes to the appropriate pod through a resource called "Ingress". While the Kubernetes API provides Ingress resources that allow you to define routing rules, the rules do not take effect until you have created an ingress controller to implement them.
- **HAProxy Ingress Controller:** See [here](https://www.haproxy.com/documentation/kubernetes/latest/usage/overview/) and [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengsettingupingresscontroller.htm).
- **Ingress / Egress:** A general definition of ingress means going in, or entering. In networking, ingress refers to traffic entering a network, for example HTTP requests traveling into your corporate network towards a web server. Traffic exiting, which is to say responses leaving your network and traveling outwards towards a user, is called egress. In the context of Kubernetes, ingress means web traffic entering your Kubernetes cluster, destined for one pod or another.
